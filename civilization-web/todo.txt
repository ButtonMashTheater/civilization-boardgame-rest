Nice to have: (Will be implemented in later versions)
- Implement email verification on register?
- Upload of the map after you powerpoint it
  -- Must have forward/back buttons so that you can review history of the maps
  -- Will send the jpg/png to the server, and save it in mongodb
- Probably need to implement turns, so that you can filter on turns and see what orders where from what turns etc
  -- Same with maps. Should perhaps be connected with the turns
- Register new players

#DONE  -- Only players playing the game can undo
#DONE Reveal from useritem
#DONE  -- To do this I need to send the item info and use the gamelog to find the item and reveal it.

#Spørsmål
- Why can't I get log.item.name to appear in voting modal
- Why is the GetGameById watch being called twice, and everything is duplicated for a second before it is removed
