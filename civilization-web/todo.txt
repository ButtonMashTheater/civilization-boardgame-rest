Nice to have: (Will be implemented in later versions)
- each image onclick with enlarge 200%
- Implement email verification on register?
- Upload of the map after you powerpoint it
  -- Must have forward/back buttons so that you can review history of the maps
  -- Will send the jpg/png to the server, and save it in mongodb
- Probably need to implement turns, so that you can filter on turns and see what orders where from what turns etc
  -- Same with maps. Should perhaps be connected with the turns
#DONE - Register new players
#DONE - Undo
#DONE  -- Only players playing the game can undo
#DONE Reveal from useritem
#DONE  -- To do this I need to send the item info and use the gamelog to find the item and reveal it.
- Add a different theme from http://bootswatch.com/

#DONE - Choose civ
#DONE  - Some starting techs should be displayed as level 1. For instance Democracy for Greece, Irrigation for Aztecs and so on.

- Resolve entire game controller before showing anything
- Game list
  -- Need a way to end a game so that active is set to false and it doesn't show on the game list
  -- Need a way to show the finished games (Perhaps active/finished tab)
  -- A way to show "My games" (Perhaps a checkbox filter)
  -- Pagination on the list would be nice, otherwise that page might become pretty long
  -- Sort newest first? Or eldest first?
  -- When creating a game, then going back to the view, it gives you the cache
    -- Must disable the cache or invalidate it when you create a game, or join

check ngmodules.org to find modules

#Spørsmål
#FIXED - Why can't I get log.item.name to appear in voting modal
- Why is the GetGameById watch being called twice, and everything is duplicated for a second before it is removed
#FIXED - Why isn't publiclog and privatelogs get updated when I draw unit and barbarian for battle? Do I need to call reload()? In that case, how?
