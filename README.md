Civlization boardgame (Fantasy Flight Games) Randomizer
=================================

This will hopefully be a web application where you can use to randomize items for the Civilization boardgame.

This project will consist of server and client, where the server will create Play By Forum games and shuffle cards and hand out items to players.
The client will be a web application that can create games, let players join these games and make draws.

The first version will be pretty basic, but the hope is that it will become a fully playable game where the players can play the boardgame online by moving items over the board.
