I wanted a clean setup to work with. I found three promising options. The angular seed project which is located on the angularjs site. Cleverstack and Yeoman.

The reason I didn't continue with the seed project is that I couldn't get bower and nodejs to correctly work.

I had lots of problems with nodejs and bower to correctly work in Ubuntu. This resulted in not getting yeoman or cleverstack to work.
Cleverstack looked pretty promising.

I tried installing nodejs from apt-get, and updating to the latest nodejs and bower versions, but still I got some issues.
Finally I installed nodejs from source and used $HOME/local for all the global files to avoid permission issues.

Now I could finally get yeoman to generate a angular app for me. However cleverstack still complained about some issues.

- Huge downside when your API is set, and you decide to change your API. You can't remove items unless you know there are no one that uses your API
and that there are no active games up and running. I think accessing inactive games for readability later is problematic!
-- Its exactly like the serialization issues we had with Java that made us go away from that


GOTCHA
$http.delete doesn't work with content-type

- Travis for continous integration
- Ikke lett Ã¥ ha parent pom og intellij. Finner ikke config fil. Maven klarer fint, men ikke intellij
- Java 8 and checked exception in lambdas doesn't play well
