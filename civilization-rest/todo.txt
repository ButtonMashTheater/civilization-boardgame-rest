- Create revealing; possibility to reveal items/units/techs
- Choose Techs
	-- Techs will not be revealed until all players have pushed submit/reveal button (Same functionality as voting)
- Choose starting player
	-- Should be randomly chosen, only when all players have joined
	-- All drawing is disabled until all players have joined
	-- Should be triggered when a player joins a game
- End of turn button which will disable drawing for players
	-- Each this happens, system will enable for next player in line
- Send player items
	-- Allowing players to send Huts, Villages, Culture cards privately to other players
	-- That player should get the item sent, plus logged both publicly that trading has taken place, plus privatly
- No players should be able to draw items when it is not their turn
	-- Except, they should be able to send stuff to other players, and choosing techs, because these are done simultanously, or if it is too difficult, then everything is turn based
- Logging
	-- Would be nice to get eventbus for private and public logging so that their will be loose coupling

Nice to have
- Chat with scrolling capabilites.
	-- Websocket?
- Each item can have path to a picture so that client can show it
- Create a battlefield, for now only use the reveal option
- Option to leave a game
	-- Haven't thought of all the details about this
