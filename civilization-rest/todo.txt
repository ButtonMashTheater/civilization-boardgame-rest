#DONE - Create revealing; possibility to hidden items/units/techs
    #DONE -- Either let players when fighting do it as now, and then after battle hidden all units
- Battle
    -- A dropdown with number of units to draw
    -- Must support undo in-case wrong number of units is drawn
    -- After battle, perhaps have a end battle button, it will show all the draws that where made
        -- For now a battle is just revealing units that where drawn by the system
        -- Perhaps a end battle button both players will need to push, which will hidden all units that where drawn
    -- Must be able to kill/delete units/item, they will be put back in pbf
#DONE - Choose Techs
	*MAYBE* -- Techs will not be revealed until all players have pushed submit/hidden button (Same functionality as voting)
	*MAYBE* for now they must undo -- Option to alter a specific chosen tech which has not been revealed
	#DONE -- If undo's his chosen tech, it must be removed from playerhand.tech()
#DONE - Choose starting player
	#DONE -- Should be randomly chosen, only when all players have joined
	#DONE -- All drawing is disabled until all players have joined. (If only the starting player can draw, then in theory this should be redundant)
	#DONE -- Should be triggered when a player joins a game
- Undo
    -- Consider if undo should reveal all info or just public
    #DONE -- Create a method that lists all undoes a player has to vote for
    #DONE -- Vote for undo
    #DONE -- List all successful votes
    #DONE -- List all finished unsuccessful votes
#DONE - End of turn
    #DONE -- will disable drawing of items for players
	#DONE -- Each this happens, system will enable for next player in line
#DONE - Send player items
	#DONE -- Allowing players to send Huts, Villages, Culture cards privately to other players
	#DONE -- That player should get the item sent, plus logged both publicly that trading has taken place, plus privately
#DONE - No players should be able to draw items when it is not their turn
	#DONE -- Except, they should be able to send stuff to other players, and choosing techs, because these are done simultanously, or if it is too difficult, then everything is turn based
- Logging
    #DONE -- Public logs are just for info. Need to differentiate Gamelog
    #DONE-- Trading for instance should have a different log, now its says "X drew hut"
#DONE - CachingAuthentication
- Draws
    -- When there is no more elements to draw, system must get the items from excel sheet and put back in the pbf
        -- Should cache itemReader and put content in cache loader with sheetname as key <-- This is helpful for creating new games fast
            -- The we can have weak values/keys
            -- At one point we must create a key with GameType + SheetName
	
Nice to have
- Chat with scrolling capabilites.
	-- Websocket?
- Each item can have path to a picture so that client can show it
- Create a filter that is for /civilization/pbf/{pbfId}* which takes the pbfId and the logged in player, and check if that player has access to the game, and proceeds if they do
- Create a battlefield, for now only use the hidden option
- Change to social authentication
- Option to leave a game
	-- Haven't thought of all the details about this
	-- This is probably not that difficult. Just put all playerhand info in another playerhand
- Possibility to request undo of end of turn?
    -- For now, this can only be done if all players just push end of turn until it goes back to the correct player
- Perhaps when players choose tech it should be intersection between pbf.getTech() and player.getTech() so that only distinct techs shows
- Instead of Basic authentication, it would be nice to support OAUTH
- Would be nice to get eventbus for private and public logging so that their will be loose coupling
- For now sending public items (resources) doesnt need sending in the system, but for fully playable version we need support for it
- Change basic authentication to OAUTH


Future
- Replace MongoJack with Morphia as MongoJack is no longer maintained it seems
